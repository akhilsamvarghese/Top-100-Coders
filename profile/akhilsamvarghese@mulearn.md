### About Me

Hi there! I'm a passionate self-taught tech enthusiast and hobbyist who’s deeply interested in cybersecurity. I love crafting software solutions and ensuring they're secure from digital threats.

I'm particularly intrigued by SIGINT (Signals Intelligence), where I explore the fascinating world of intercepting and decoding signals for insights.

Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) has become a particular interest of mine. The idea of intercepting and decoding signals to gain insights into communication systems fascinates me. I'm drawn to the technical aspects of intercepting and analyzing signals, all while adhering to ethical and legal boundaries.

I'm always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills in these domains. Whether it's learning about the latest programming languages, experimenting with ethical hacking techniques, or delving deeper into the world of SIGINT, I'm committed to continuous growth.

I have experience in a range of technologies, including Python, C and MySQL

I'm all about continuous learning and enjoy collaborating on tech projects. Let's connect and explore the boundless possibilities in the tech universe!
